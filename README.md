# TopicModelling

Topic models are a class of unsupervised clustering algorithms used to discover topics
or themes in a collection of documents. In this project we have applied the latent Dirichlet
allocation (LDA) topic model on a collection of genetics related abstracts. I used web scraping
tools in Python to extract abstracts from genetics related journals in Nature to apply the LDA topic
model. I explored the evolution of topics in the various journals and over the years to get an
understanding of topic evolution in the journals.
